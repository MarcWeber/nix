Subject: [PATCH] experimental/debug-coercions-as-xml

We're all pretty helpless seeing messages like:

  value is an attribute set while a list was expected

This patch add sthe flag --xml-debug-coercion-failure
making nix output the xml representation of the attribute set
- which of course may fail eg if infinite recursions are used.
However its more often useful than failing.
